# 🏥 Clinic Management System

The **Clinic Management System** is a full-stack **DBMS project** designed to simplify and automate the daily operations of a clinic. It connects a **MySQL database** with a **Node.js backend** and a **frontend built using HTML and CSS**. The system allows efficient management of patients, doctors, appointments, prescriptions, and billing, creating a reliable digital workflow for clinical operations.

##  Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of front-end, back-end, and database technologies to build a complete and functional healthcare management system. It supports **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) across all entities and ensures smooth coordination between patients and doctors through a relational database model.

The **frontend** is designed with HTML and CSS for a clean, responsive user interface. The **backend**, built using Node.js with Express.js, handles routing, server logic, and database connectivity. The **MySQL** database stores all structured data with relational integrity across multiple tables.
